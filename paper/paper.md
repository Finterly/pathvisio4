# Summary
describing the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience.

GPML (Graphical Pathway Markup Language) was originally... It was later ....libGPML is a Java library....that is more easily updated, built, released, and used. A subset of the original functionality is available, and some managers have already been updated to
use more recent versions of dependencies.

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }



# Statement of Need
clearly illustrates the research purpose of the software.

Moving to GPML2021 format....While pathvisio core library has served our research for many years, a number of limitations has made
this increasingly hard. ...

# Implementation
## Continuous integration and releases





# Use cases
Mention (if applicable) a representative set of past or ongoing research projects using the software and recent scholarly publications enabled by it.
Pathvisio and GPML scripts have been in use in our group in various research lines to automate repetitive work.
